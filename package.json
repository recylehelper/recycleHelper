  "description": "This app is designed to make it easier for those who would recycle but tend to throw away their waste rather than risk recycling something that can't be recycled, or won't in their municipality. This app will allow users to search for specific products to see it's makeup, and if it can be recycled (along with any additional steps the recycler needs to take for it to be recycled).",
