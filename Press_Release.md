There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Project ##
  > recycleHelper

## Who it's for ##
  > this app is for people who want to recycle, but tend to toss items in the trash when they are unsure if their city can recycle it.

## Summary ##
  > This app is designed to make it easier for those who would recycle but tend to throw away their waste rather than risk recycling something that can't be recycled, or won't in their municipality. This app will allow users to search for specific products to see it's makeup, and if it can be recycled (along with any additional steps the recycler needs to take for it to be recycled). 

## Problem ##
  > Many people, myself included, want to recycle, but often find themselves unsure of the item they just finished using can be recycled by their city/apartment recycling pick up service. And instead of going through an arduous process of googling and searching the web, most people just toss it in the trash to be safe. This app will help users get that information with such ease that they search before deciding to just toss it to save the trouble.

## Solution #
  > This app will pull from a large database, information about specific products. Namely the information of what their makeup is, and where it can be recycled if at all. For example, if you are looking at a coca-cola can, this app will tell you what it's made up of, can it be recycled in your zip code, and any additional steps needed for the recycling crew to recycle it (for a coke can, rinsing out the soda residue from the can).

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just download this app, allow it to access your location, and search away!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > This app is a great starting point in doing your part to support the environment, but know that only 20% of 'recycled' goods actually get recycled. Utilize the other 2 R's more! Reduce and Reuse!
